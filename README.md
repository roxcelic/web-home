## Hey!

This is the GitHub repo for my [website](https://roxcelic.love). I've based this website on music, very highly. With my other website designs, I felt I had little control over them when they were deployed, which really was not what I wanted. I wanted this website to be a way I could express myself at any time, anywhere, so...

This website utilizes the following resources to allow me to do this:
> https://api.roxcelic.love

> https://files.roxcelic.love/status/status.json

> the Last.fm API

> my personal [Fedi](https://fedi.roxcelic.love)'s API

> the Spotify API

This allows me to have the website constantly updating with content at any time of the day, most of it automatic. The only part which requires any effort from me is the status feature, which you will notice as the page's subheading. This can take the form of a [string, image, HTML], giving me a lot more control. With this all being open source, it is impossible for me to do anything sketchy that any other website would not be able to do.
