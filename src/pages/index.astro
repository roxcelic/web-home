						If you're here, you must have at least heard of me, right? Well, if you haven't, I'm a weirdo who spends her time doing morally questionable things with computers—less in the "bad bad" morally questionable and more in the "why the `%$£%` are you doing this" questionable. For example, I made a Python and JS terminal thing (which is mostly dead now) just because—the Python one even had plugins!<br>

						Enough about me, behold me!<br>
						So, I'm a 16-year-old gal who is, what I like to joke, a `technomancer` (yes, I stole that from Regular Show; what are you gonna do?) Despite the name, I'm actually really good at breaking tech—just check out my A12 for that, lmao. I use she/they pronouns, and I'm aiming to get into a game development college sometime in the near future. Yeah, it's kinda scary that I'm going to college, but it was bound to happen eventually, right? Anyways...
