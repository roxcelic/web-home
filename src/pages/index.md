# Hey!
I'm Roxie, a 17-year-old game developer (in training now, I guess). If I'm being honest, I much prefer web development, but that's only a hobby.  
If anyone would like, I'm probably open for commissions though.

<br>

I play a lot of games (I play like 3) because I'm a super well-versed game design student, of course.  
My faves are:
- Pok√©mon Black & White
- Terraria
- Celeste
- Cyberpunk 2077

<br>

I love music soooo much too, if you couldn't tell by this website's design, lmao...
