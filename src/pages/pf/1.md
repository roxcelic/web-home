For my first school project, the brief was to create a 3D game for *Unreal Engine*, with the following conditions:
- No budget
- 3-week time limit (not including planning, which we were given 2 weeks for)
- Player controller
- Must be a "horror environment"

What I decided to make was a little more complicated than we were instructed to:
- Random spawn location
- Procedurally generated map
- 11 endings
- 7 sets of dialogue
- Tutorial

The game was very "plain" looking, in all honesty, until I added the shader. It is a post-processing effect, if I remember correctly. This means it renders after everything else, which makes it apply the effect to **everything**.

There are multiple ways to die/lose, but in the video, you can only see one of them. For example, a randomly spawning gnome will follow you and eventually kill you, or you can run out of time (a random time limit is set between 300 and 420 seconds).

I really feel like this deserved better.
