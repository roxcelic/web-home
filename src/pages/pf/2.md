For my second school project, the brief was to create a 2.5D platformer for Blender, with the following conditions:
- No budget
- 4-week time limit (not including planning, which we were given a single week for)
- 2 levels / scenes
- Must be a 2.5D platformer with:
    - An end screen
    - A main menu
- 3 3D models
    - The player character must be one

What I decided to do for my game is one of the most complex things I've had to do in 4 weeks:
- Level creation engine
    - Includes level testing
    - Online sharing
    - Level saving
- On-screen keyboard
- Full remake of the Unity Input System
    - You can set custom mapping for both controller and keyboard
        - They save too!
- Skins
    - 6 of them, if I remember correctly
- Collectables
- Fully animated main menu
- Rewrote part of the Unity time system for more accurate calculations for me
    - Yes, I understand this is bad practice, but it was more of a patch than anything, and I only had 4 weeks
- A hard mode difficulty option
- A gravity control engine
